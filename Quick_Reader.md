Of course. Here is a more detailed explanation of the SOLID principles, complete with the mall/e-commerce analogy and expanded coding examples for each principle.

-----

## **S - Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

### The Principle

**"A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job."**

This principle is about focus and cohesion. A module or class should be responsible for a single part of your application's functionality. When responsibilities are mixed, a change in one feature can unexpectedly break another.

### The Problem (Incorrect Example)

In our e-commerce backend, a single `OrderProcessor` class handles everything: calculating the final price (a Finance concern), updating inventory (a Logistics concern), and sending a confirmation email (a Marketing concern). This class has three different reasons to change.

```python
# Before SRP: The "God" Class
class OrderProcessor:
    def process_order(self, order_data):
        # 1. Responsibility to FINANCE: Calculate total
        subtotal = sum(item['price'] * item['qty'] for item in order_data['items'])
        tax = subtotal * 0.18
        final_total = subtotal + tax
        print(f"Finance: Calculated total ${final_total}")

        # 2. Responsibility to LOGISTICS: Update inventory
        for item in order_data['items']:
            print(f"Logistics: Decrementing stock for {item['sku']}")
            # ... logic to call warehouse API ...

        # 3. Responsibility to MARKETING: Send email
        print(f"Marketing: Sending confirmation to {order_data['customer_email']}")
        # ... logic to call email service ...
        
        return {"status": "SUCCESS"}
```

### The Solution (Correct Example)

Like a mall has specialized roles (accountant, stock clerk), we separate the code into specialized services.

```python
# After SRP: Specialized Services

# pricing_service.py (Finance's responsibility)
class PricingService:
    def calculate_total(self, items):
        subtotal = sum(item['price'] * item['qty'] for item in items)
        tax = subtotal * 0.18
        return subtotal + tax

# inventory_service.py (Logistics' responsibility)
class InventoryService:
    def update_stock(self, items):
        for item in items:
            print(f"Logistics: Decrementing stock for {item['sku']}")
            # ... logic to call warehouse API ...

# notification_service.py (Marketing's responsibility)
class NotificationService:
    def send_order_confirmation(self, email):
        print(f"Marketing: Sending confirmation to {email}")
        # ... logic to call email service ...

# A coordinator that uses the services
class OrderWorkflow:
    def __init__(self, pricing_svc, inventory_svc, notification_svc):
        self.pricing_svc = pricing_svc
        self.inventory_svc = inventory_svc
        self.notification_svc = notification_svc

    def run(self, order_data):
        total = self.pricing_svc.calculate_total(order_data['items'])
        self.inventory_svc.update_stock(order_data['items'])
        self.notification_svc.send_order_confirmation(order_data['customer_email'])
        return {"status": "SUCCESS"}
```

### The Payoff

A change to the tax calculation now only happens in `PricingService`, with **zero risk** of breaking the inventory or email logic. Teams can work on their respective services in parallel without conflict.

-----

## **O - Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**

### The Principle

**"Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification."**

You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing, stable code. Think of your core modules as having "plug-in" slots.

### The Problem (Incorrect Example)

Our `ShippingService` is hardcoded to handle one delivery partner. To add a new partner, we must modify the core class with an `if/else` block, which is risky.

```python
# Before OCP: Requires modification for new features
class ShippingService:
    def create_shipment(self, order, carrier):
        if carrier == 'QuickExpress':
            # Logic specific to QuickExpress
            print("Creating QuickExpress shipment...")
            return "QE-123"
        # To add a new carrier, we MUST edit this file and add an 'elif'
        # elif carrier == 'BoeingDelivery':
        #     ...
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unknown carrier")
```

### The Solution (Correct Example)

Like a mall's loading dock is open to any truck, our `ShippingService` should be open to any delivery partner that follows a standard interface.

```python
# After OCP: Extensible with plug-ins
from typing import Protocol

# The "Loading Dock" - an abstract interface
class DeliveryPartner(Protocol):
    def create_label(self, order) -> str: ...

# A "Truck" - a concrete implementation for QuickExpress
class QuickExpressAdapter(DeliveryPartner):
    def create_label(self, order) -> str:
        print("Creating QuickExpress shipment...")
        return "QE-123"

# Another "Truck" - a new plug-in for BoeingDelivery
class BoeingDeliveryAdapter(DeliveryPartner):
    def create_label(self, order) -> str:
        print("Creating BoeingDelivery shipment...")
        return "BD-456"

# The refactored service depends on the abstraction, not the concrete class
class ShippingService:
    def create_shipment(self, order, partner: DeliveryPartner):
        # This code is now "closed for modification"
        tracking_number = partner.create_label(order)
        return tracking_number

# We can now add new carriers by creating new adapter classes
# without ever touching the ShippingService.
```

### The Payoff

The business can onboard new delivery partners quickly and safely. We add new features by adding new code (`BoeingDeliveryAdapter`), not by risking changes to old, stable code (`ShippingService`).

-----

## **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

### The Principle

**"...every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class."**

If you have a function that works with a base type, it should also work with any of that base type's subtypes without any issues.

### The Problem (Incorrect Example)

We have a `PaymentGateway` base class. The `CreditCardGateway` subclass behaves as expected. However, a new `StoreCreditGateway` subclass behaves differently when processing a refund: it returns a `Voucher` object instead of a `string` transaction ID. A `RefundService` that expects a string will crash.

```python
# Before LSP: Subtype breaks the contract
class PaymentGateway:
    def refund(self, amount) -> str: ...

class CreditCardGateway(PaymentGateway):
    def refund(self, amount) -> str:
        return "txn_cc_123" # Returns a string, as expected

class StoreCreditGateway(PaymentGateway):
    def refund(self, amount) -> object: # Problem: returns a different type
        print("Issuing a store credit voucher.")
        return {"voucher_code": "VOUCHER-456", "amount": amount}

def process_refund(gateway: PaymentGateway, amount: int):
    transaction_id = gateway.refund(amount)
    # This next line will CRASH when using StoreCreditGateway because transaction_id
    # is an object, not a string with an upper() method.
    print(f"Processed refund with transaction ID: {transaction_id.upper()}")
```

### The Solution (Correct Example)

All payment terminals in a mall must behave predictably. In code, all subclasses must honor the contract of the parent class, including return types.

```python
# After LSP: Subtypes honor the contract
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class RefundResult:
    status: str
    message: str

class PaymentGateway:
    def refund(self, amount) -> RefundResult: ...

class CreditCardGateway(PaymentGateway):
    def refund(self, amount) -> RefundResult:
        return RefundResult(status="success", message="txn_cc_123")

class StoreCreditGateway(PaymentGateway):
    def refund(self, amount) -> RefundResult:
        # Now returns the same type, honoring the contract
        return RefundResult(status="success", message="voucher_code: VOUCHER-456")

def process_refund(gateway: PaymentGateway, amount: int):
    result = gateway.refund(amount)
    # This code now works for any gateway because the contract is consistent
    print(f"Refund status: {result.status}, Message: {result.message}")
```

### The Payoff

The system is now predictable and reliable. We can confidently use any `PaymentGateway` subtype in our `process_refund` function without fear of unexpected crashes.

-----

## **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

### The Principle

**"A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesnâ€™t use..."**

Interfaces should be small and focused on a specific role. Large, "do-everything" interfaces create unnecessary dependencies.

### The Problem (Incorrect Example)

We have one massive `IPaymentGateway` interface that includes methods for everything: one-time payments, refunds, and recurring subscriptions. A simple `CashOnDelivery` payment method, which cannot handle subscriptions, is still forced to implement the `start_subscription` method.

```python
# Before ISP: The "fat" interface
class IPaymentGateway(Protocol):
    def charge(self, amount): ...
    def refund(self, transaction_id, amount): ...
    def start_subscription(self, plan_id): ... # Unrelated method

class CashOnDeliveryGateway(IPaymentGateway):
    def charge(self, amount):
        print("User will pay on delivery.")
    def refund(self, transaction_id, amount):
        print("Processing cash refund.")
    def start_subscription(self, plan_id):
        # This class is forced to implement a method it doesn't need.
        raise NotImplementedError("Cash on Delivery does not support subscriptions.")
```

### The Solution (Correct Example)

A coffee kiosk in a mall only needs an electrical outlet, not the large water pipes required by a restaurant. We should provide smaller, role-specific interfaces.

```python
# After ISP: Smaller, focused interfaces
class IChargeable(Protocol):
    def charge(self, amount): ...

class IRefundable(Protocol):
    def refund(self, transaction_id, amount): ...

class ISubscribable(Protocol):
    def start_subscription(self, plan_id): ...

# A class now implements only the interfaces it needs
class CashOnDeliveryGateway(IChargeable, IRefundable):
    def charge(self, amount):
        print("User will pay on delivery.")
    def refund(self, transaction_id, amount):
        print("Processing cash refund.")

# Another class might need all three
class StripeGateway(IChargeable, IRefundable, ISubscribable):
    def charge(self, amount): ...
    def refund(self, transaction_id, amount): ...
    def start_subscription(self, plan_id): ...
```

### The Payoff

The code is cleaner and more logical. Clients are not forced to depend on methods they don't use, which reduces coupling and makes the system easier to understand.

-----

## **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

### The Principle

**"Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. ...the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions."**

High-level business logic should not depend on low-level implementation details (like a specific database or payment provider). Both should depend on a shared abstraction (an interface).

### The Problem (Incorrect Example)

Our high-level `CheckoutService` directly imports and instantiates a low-level `StripeProcessor`. This creates a tight coupling. If we want to switch to PayPal, we have to change the core `CheckoutService`.

```python
# Before DIP: High-level depends on low-level
class StripeProcessor: # This is a low-level detail
    def pay(self, amount):
        print(f"Charging ${amount} with Stripe.")

class CheckoutService: # This is our high-level business logic
    def __init__(self):
        # Direct dependency on the concrete, low-level class
        self.processor = StripeProcessor()
    
    def complete_checkout(self, amount):
        self.processor.pay(amount)
```

### The Solution (Correct Example)

The mall's structure (high-level) depends on abstract steel beams, not the specific brand of furniture (low-level) in a store. Our `CheckoutService` should depend on an abstract `IPaymentProcessor` interface.

```python
# After DIP: Both depend on an abstraction
class IPaymentProcessor(Protocol): # The abstraction
    def pay(self, amount): ...

class StripeProcessor(IPaymentProcessor): # Low-level detail implements the abstraction
    def pay(self, amount):
        print(f"Charging ${amount} with Stripe.")

class PayPalProcessor(IPaymentProcessor): # Another low-level detail
    def pay(self, amount):
        print(f"Charging ${amount} with PayPal.")

class CheckoutService: # High-level logic depends on the abstraction
    def __init__(self, processor: IPaymentProcessor): # Dependency is injected
        self.processor = processor
    
    def complete_checkout(self, amount):
        self.processor.pay(amount)

# Now, we can easily switch providers without changing CheckoutService
stripe = StripeProcessor()
checkout1 = CheckoutService(processor=stripe)
checkout1.complete_checkout(100)

paypal = PayPalProcessor()
checkout2 = CheckoutService(processor=paypal)
checkout2.complete_checkout(100)
```

### The Payoff

The system is decoupled and flexible. We can swap out low-level details like payment providers or databases without ever touching our high-level business logic. This makes the code easier to maintain, test, and adapt to future changes.
